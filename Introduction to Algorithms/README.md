# Introduction to Algortithms

## by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein

This Book is incredibly extensive (with over 1200 pages) and is aimed at both students, teachers and everybody else interested enough.

I am currently still in the process of reading this book. Each chapter has several tasks for the reader to work on, of which I will attempt to solve as many as I can.
